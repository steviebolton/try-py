    -----------------
    Which Media Type is most popular?
    How could you answer this with a single query?
    You probably can't based on what you know so far. We'll get there.
    For now, you can use a separate query for each media type so see how many tracks use it.
    Expected : MPEG audio file

  3. Disaster, we've heard from Steve Johnson's lawyers.
     He claims that Michael Mitchell was hired on the same day as him,
     but was hired later in the day. Mitchell should have been let go, not him.

     Confirm this by extending the number of results and make sure nobody else was
     hired on that day.

     Then modify the query to return the correct 3 people.

     Continue to use HireDate as the primary sort column, but use EmployeeId as the tie breaker.
     Assume that a higher EmployeeId means they were hired later.

     Expected : 3 rows (starting with the following)
      8	  Laura	  Callahan	  2004-03-04 00:00:00
      7	  Robert	King	      2004-01-02 00:00:00
      6	  Michael	Mitchell	  2003-10-17 00:00:00

  4. Create a query that shows our 10 biggest invoices by Total value, in descending order.
     If two invoices have the same Total, the more recent should appear first.
     The query should also show the Name of the Customer

     An Easy way to show the name would be to include the FirstName and LastName columns from
     the Customer table. However, if you use the concatenation operator you can combine those
     fields into one column in the results.

     Expected: 10 rows
